How to get and compile libffi in order to build yabasic under Windows:

- Clone https://github.com/winlibs/libffi
- Make sure, that compiler settings of yabasic and libffi are comparable,
  e.g. laufzeitbibliothek for c-compiler
- Build win32/vc14_x64/libffi-msvc.sln with Visual C++ 2015
- The result is win32/vc14_x86/Release/libffi.lib
  - copy it to yabasic/windows/lang
  - this file is not part of yabasics repository (listed in .gitignore)
- Maybe update yabasic/windows/lang/ffi.h and other headers from 
  libffi/include/ffi.h
