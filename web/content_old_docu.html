    <h1>The old documentation of yabasic</h1>
    <p>The <a href="yabasic_old.html">old documentation</a> of yabasic has been replaced 
      in August 2003 by a complete rewrite, the <a href="yabasic_new.html">new documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>However, the old documentation still has its merits: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For one it takes a more holistic approach; i.e. in most cases a single 
	example explains many different features. So with the old documentation 
	more things&nbsp;can be learned with a short read (albeit not in every detail).</li>
      <li>Second, there is a <a href="yabasic_old_de.html">german translation</a> 
	of the old documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, keep in mind, that the old documentation has not been updated from 
      August 2003 on, i.e. it only documents the version 2.72 of yabasic. New features 
      are only described within the new documentation.</p>
