This directory contains everything needed to build yabasic and
its documentation under various flavours of unix.

The Rakefile (type 'rake' to invoke) orchestrates the process of
building the yabasic executable and its documentation; it relies
heavily on the autocof toolchain and its Makefile.

The two subdirectories:

- lang :: The complete code for the Yabasic interpreter
- doc :: The docbook-xml-sources for its documentation
