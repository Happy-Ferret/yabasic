Some hints: 

- To advance the Version of yabasic:
  - Edit configure.ac and NEWS
  - Build and push under unix
  - Pull, build and push under windows and web
  - Add a matching annotated tag after all platforms have been built
    (like git tag -a -m 2.81.2 2.81.2)

- Every build is a debug build, typically like: ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" && make

- To compile with profiling information: export CFLAGS="-pg --coverage" ; ./configure ; make
  - Then run yabasic as normal: ./yabasic tests/common/speed-yab
  - Run gprof: gprof ./yabasic
  - Or run gcov: gcov main.c
  - WARNING: adding "--coverage" to CFLAGS slows down yabasic by a factor of 3 or more
