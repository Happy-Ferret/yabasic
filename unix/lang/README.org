Some hints: 

- Every build is a debug build, typically like: ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" && make

- To compile with profiling information: export CFLAGS="-pg --coverage" ; ./configure ; make
  - Then run yabasic as normal: ./yabasic tests/common/speed-yab
  - Run gprof: gprof ./yabasic
  - Or run gcov: gcov main.c
  - WARNING: adding "--coverage" to CFLAGS slows down yabasic by a factor of 3 or more
